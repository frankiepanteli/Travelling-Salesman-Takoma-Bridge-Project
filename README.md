# Travelling-Salesman-Takoma-Bridge-Project
This is a computational science project I completed as part of a numerical modelling project in Physics. This implemented simulated annealing in a Jupyter environment to solve the travelling salesman problem, and numerical methods to solve second order linear differential equations of motion for the Tacoma Narrows bridge.
