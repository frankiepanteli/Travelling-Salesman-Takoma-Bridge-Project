# Python-Monte-Carlo-TSP-Takoma-Bridge-Project

Project executive summary:

This is a computational science project I completed as part of a numerical modelling project in Physics. This implemented simulated annealing in a Jupyter environment to solve the travelling salesman problem, and numerical methods to solve second order linear differential equations of motion for the Tacoma Narrows bridge via the Taylor and Cromer methods. 

Abstract:

The TSP aims to produce a tour of shortest distance through a given number of locations. Numerical methods used to solve this problem for thirty cities on a map of North America include the simulated annealing algorithm and Monte Carlo sampling, finding a path of shortest distance equal to 2233 arbitrary units of distance. Numerical methods used to model the Tacoma Narrows bridge collapse are the McKenna model, Taylor and Cromer methods. This project found that maximal bridge resonance occured under a wind force amplitude equal to 2N, with wind of an angular velocity equal to 3rad/s - matching its literature value. Extensions to the former problem were discussed in the form of a TSP for London Underground stations and extensions to the latter are discussed in the form of foot-force models for pedestrians driving bridge collapse.
